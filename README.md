# Prediction-of-Heart-Attack-Risk
From a dataset with medical data such as blood pressure and cholesterol, heart attack risk rates are estimated. After preprocessing, various regression models are applied and evaluated on the training and test sets using common metrics. The best model can be identified and overfitting detected through evaluation on the two sets.
